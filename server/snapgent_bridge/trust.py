"""Which browser extensions the user has approved to control the bridge.

The scheme check (security.py) keeps WEBSITES out, but every installed extension passes it, and an
extension that is not snapgent could ask the bridge to run tools, add servers and even approve its own
confirmation tokens. So an extension must be approved once by the person at the keyboard, the way SSH
asks about a new host. The bridge runs in a terminal window the user is looking at, so it asks there.

Rejecting the first attempt immediately (instead of holding the socket open) keeps this simple: the
extension reconnects every few seconds and succeeds as soon as the answer is "yes".
